In *Befriending Our Bodies*, Jon Kabat-Zinn talks about the importance of our relationship with our body in this course. The last video guides you through a *Raisin Meditation* using two ordinary raisins. $To get the most benefit out of this video, have two raisins and a glass of water with you so you can experience on your own what is described in the video.$"),
