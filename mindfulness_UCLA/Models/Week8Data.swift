        introTextParagraph1: ("Dealing with Difficult Emotions or Physical Pain", "So far in this course, when some difficulty presents itself during meditation in the form of a thought, emotion, or physical sensation, we have been simply acknowledging it and then “firmly but gently” returning to the object of awareness (for instance, breath in the sitting meditation). This week, we introduce a new way to deal with difficult emotions or physical pain, called #*\"Turning Toward\"*# that involves intentionally exploring the difficulty rather than moving away from it. This is a powerful method, but it is deeply counter-intuitive, because the last thing we think we want to do is to move closer to what's been troubling us."),
        introTextParagraph2: ("", "When used as an informal practice, #*\"Turning Toward\"*# can be thought of as a more nuanced form of STOP (\"One-Minute Breathing Space\") that allows for a fuller exploration of what's happening. Although such an exploration might sound scary and uncomfortable, this is a gentle process, and is done in a special way, one that draws on the skills of awareness and non-judgment that you've been building so far in this course."),

In *One Moment at a Time*, she describes the moment her approach to dealing with her chronic pain changed and her life's work in understanding and teaching this approach began. The other videos, including *Pain x Resistance = Suffering*, deal with a variety of issues having to do with this week's topic, and in *The Three Components of Self-Compassion*, Kristin Neff talks about the importance of dealing with difficult emotional and physical issues with self-kindness and gentleness. If you are dealing with significant physical pain, be sure to watch Tara Brach's *Working Skillfully* with Pain and *Guided Reflection on Inhabiting this Body* in the supplementary section."),

Vidyamala Burch's *Five-Step Model* inspired these informal practices and the corresponding \"Turning Toward\" meditations. Tara Brach's *Radical Acceptance* comes from her book by the same name and talks about the two \"wings\" of Radical Acceptance, clear seeing and self-compassion, both very important for \"Turning Toward\". #If you or a loved one is dealing with back pain, *The Strange Case of Chronic Back Pain*, in the Supplementary section, is a must-read.#"),
