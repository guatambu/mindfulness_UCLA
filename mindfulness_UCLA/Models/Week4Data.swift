        introTextParagraph1: ("this week's videos", "We begin with *Stress - Portrait of a Killer*, featuring Robert Sapolsky, a neuroscientist at Stanford University and possibly the world's greatest authority on the causes and effects of stress. This video describes the physiology of stress and how, in modern life, our stress response, designed evolutionarily to protect us from danger, can actually put our lives in danger when it is activated continually and without resolution. This is the bad news."),
        introTextParagraph2: ("", "The good news, *How To Make Stress Your Friend*, comes from Kelly McGonigal, a psychologist specializing in health medicine, who puts stress in perspective, re-framing stress, not as an enemy to health and well-being, but as a response which is protective and even life-giving. She perhaps goes a little too far in saying that health-endangering stress simply comes from a \"belief that stress is bad\", but her video provides a good counter-balance to the idea that stress is always bad. In the last video, *STOP: A Short Mindfulness Practice*, Susan Bauer-Wu describes how mindfulness can counteract a disproportionate stress reaction and introduces you to *STOP*, which you can use literally anywhere, anytime, to ground you and help you to be more resilient and effective in the face of difficult situations."),

Don't expect to remember the precise steps of \"STOP\" during the most trying parts of the day - it's enough just to remember to stop and take a breath. The best way to make it second nature is to practice it when you aren't stressed, such as during the \"in between\" times, like waiting in line, walking from one office to another, getting in/out of your car, etc."),

On the last day of your practice, instead of recording your informal practice of \"STOP\", please take the time to complete the *Midway Self-Assessment Worksheet* below, included with your practice sheets."),
