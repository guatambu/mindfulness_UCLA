        introTextParagraph1: ("", "Up to this point in the course, compassion has played a subtle, but important role in our meditation practice. In fact, self-compassion may be the most important component of MBSR - it’s the oil that makes the gears of mindfulness work. Without it, the practices are at best, dry, and at worst, harsh and counter-productive."),
        introTextParagraph2: ("", "In some mindfulness courses, the linkage between mindfulness and compassion is not very explicit, focusing almost exclusively on strengthening concentration and the ability to stay with present-moment experience. This has made the mindfulness movement vulnerable to the argument that, for instance, there could be such a thing as a \"mindful\" terrorist or a \"mindful\" bank robber."),
        introTextParagraph3: ("", "Of course, something seems very wrong with this, since kindness and compassion are at the core of almost every meditative tradition. This week, we explore our natural tendency to connect and care about others, and consider the value and potential of being compassionate even beyond our closest relationships."),
        videosTextParagraph1: ("videos and readings", "The first video, *The Evolutionary Roots* of Compassion, by Dacher Keltner of U.C., Berkeley, provides evidence for the idea that we, as humans, have a deep-seated inclination to care for others. The article, *Survival of the Kindest*, indicates that even Darwin believed this. As natural as the capacity for compassion is, Matthieu Ricard, a Buddhist monk who has logged 50,000 hours of meditation practice and who also has a PhD in cellular genetics, makes the case for consciously supporting this capacity in the video, *Cultivating Altruism*."),
        videosTextParagraph2: ("", "We also explore the natural linkages there are with mindfulness and compassion in Shauna Shapiro's video, *How Mindfulness Cultivates Compassion*, and her article, Does Mindfulness Make You Compassionate?"),
        videosTextParagraph3: ("", "In our culture, it can be argued that the person we are least kind to is ourselves, and in *Self-Compassion*, Emma Seppala points out our tendency to be overly critical of ourselves and describes some ways to cultivate a healthy self-compassion. In the video, *Overcoming Objections to Self-Compassion*, and in the article, *The Five Myths of Self-Compassion*, Kristin Neff explores misconceptions about self-compassion, including the belief that motivation requires self-criticism, and the idea that being kinder to ourselves makes us complacent and less effective."),

It is a shorter practice (13 min), so when you do this meditation, you can extend it for another 17 minutes to give yourself a full 30 minutes on that day. Or, if you'd like to extend a bit of lovingkindess to yourself(!), you can stop at the end of the 13 minute meditation."),
